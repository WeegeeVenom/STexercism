# STexercism

This is a Sublime Text 3 package that allows access to some of the `exercism.io` CLI commands (and so it requires that you already have the CLI installed).

Currently supported (accessed through the command palette):
- `STexercism: Submit current exercise file`. Must be run when focused on the file to be submitted.
- `STexercism: Open current exercise on the website`. Should work on any file in the exercism directory.
- `STexercism: Test current exercise file (Python)`. Only works with the Python track, currently.(requires Pytest)
- `STexercism: Download an exercise file`. Just copy and paste the title from the exercism website for exercise name.
- `STexercism: Toggle auto-create for pytest.ini (Python)` Should remember your setting every time.
## Installation

Via package control.
